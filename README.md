# Endpoint Pass-through

A serverless API endpoint proxy pass-through, currently designed to work with Cloudflare Workers.

The objective of this project is to provide a small and lightweight package that can securely proxy connections from specific hostnames, allowing frontend apps to call APIs of various services without exposing secret keys.
